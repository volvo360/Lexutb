# Bloggy Demo

It was not a direct assignment to perform, but we would do it more ourselves or in a group. The goal was that we would gain some knowledge entity framework (EF). Our task was to make sure that it supports full CURD.

We got access to a console application to handle various blog posts with a default database. If you just read the instructions for the application, everything will go wellâ€¦ Have therefore added some code that checks if the database exists and if not, the user is prompted to run the Update-Database in the package manger console.
