# Lexicon Utbildning

A collection of exercises and tasks that we were commissioned to solve during the training for developers at Lexicon during our 12-week period.

Change branches to take part in the different exercises we had to carry out. Note that I have chosen to make a little more advanced solutions than what was required of us. Has always had in mind to make the code flexible and reusable in other projects. If it had been real projects then I would not have done this extra work without asking the manager / project manager.
