# Checkpoint 2

The task was to create at least two different classes, and to enter an error message in case of incorrect entry. And that you could also search for an article and mark the keyword in the search result itself.

I chose to go a few steps further in terms of challenging myself, but also to make it easier for the users of the program. Some attempts have been made to make the code a little more readable by breaking down large functions into a number of smaller sub-functions.

In other words, the task would be of the OOP type, I chose to go a step further with the files and chose to work according to the MVC methodology. To make it easier for the user, I also chose to build a flexible menu system for the service, and that the various categories and articles are saved locally to the computer. Had it been a program that would be used in reality, I would not have done it as a console application but as a website with a database connection, etc.â€¦ Now I chose to follow the intended syllabus!
