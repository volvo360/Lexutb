# Checkpoint 1

The task was to create a console program that would receive different article numbers with letters on the left side and then a hyphen and a number that is between 200-500. When you want to end the entry of articles, you must enter exit and the program must accept all forms of wording of this word such as ExIt. When you finish editing, a list of all article numbers in ascending order should be presented to the user before the program ends.

In the event of incorrect entries, the user must be notified with a warning text in red!

Has also chosen to set global parameters for different lengths on the two sides of the article number.

To avoid locking myself in too much with a predefined array with a number of fields, I have chosen to use List which is completely dynamic on this front!

The code itself is very self-explanatory in my opinion.
