# Ef Bloggy Improved

It was not a direct assignment to perform, but we would do it more ourselves or in a group. The goal was that we would gain some knowledge entity framework (EF). In my opinion, this is an improved version of the basic code that we started working on " EfBloggy ". It is certainly deliberately done that these possibilities do not exist from the beginning, but you must realize this yourself a little later when we carry out a project where we can use previous tasks as a basis. May see what I will choose a little later in the course when it comes time to complete this project.

We got access to a console application to handle various blog posts with a default database. If you just read the instructions for the application, everything will go wellâ€¦ Have therefore added some code that checks if the database exists and if not, the user is prompted to run the Update-Database in the package manger console.

I was also a little annoyed that there was no separate table / class to handle the different writers for posts. Prefers to normalize data as far as possible! We had as an exercise task to add the possibility to add a new blog post or delete blog posts in the service. Also added a timestamp on the posts to make it a little more lifelike. Therefore, I developed this improved version of the code with one to many relationships in the database.
