# Mini projec 2 (EF Inventory register)

This time the task was to update the previous version of the inventory register to work with a database in the background via Entity Framewrok (EF). I have chosen to create as general a database structure as possible so that users have the opportunity to add different types of categories with different extra properties such as e.g. smart phone.
