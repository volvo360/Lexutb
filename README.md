# LBloggy Demo

It was not a direct assignment to perform, but we would do it more ourselves or in a group. The goal was that we would gain some knowledge about databases resp. SQL. None of this was any direct news to me, more to teach me the slightly more specific SQL that applies to MS SQL server.

We got access to a console application to handle various blog posts with some associated SQL scripts. After a bit of hassle and clumsiness on my part, I got it up so I could start the program. It made me realize that you make sure that the program verifies that the database exists locally, and that the associated tables exist with certain data.
 
I was also a little annoyed that there was no separate table to handle the different writers for posts. Prefers to normalize data as far as possible! We had as an exercise task to add the possibility to add a new blog post or delete blog posts in the service. Also added a timestamp on the posts to make it a little more realistic.
