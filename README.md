# Mini project 1

This time the task was to create an inventory register for a company with at least 3 predefined offices in different countries. These countries were optional to enter, and that we would use the country's currency when entering the purchase price. There were also some requirements regarding how the inventory should be presented to the user, products that have an estimated economic life approaching 3 months should be marked in red, equipment that falls within a period of 6 months should be marked in yellow. We would also present the purchase value in SEK if it was not in SEK from the beginning.
